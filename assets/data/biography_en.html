<h2 id="chapter1">From autobiography</h2>

<p class="indented-text">A “Volga” is raising dust on a country road. Little village houses are seen in the
    distance.</p>
<p class="indented-text">Idyllic scene. A rainbow suddenly appears after a turn. It’s incredibly bright, incredibly big.
    It’s close to the road, about ten meters. Come on, drive under it, just a bit more. No, can’t catch up to it. Still
    in front of the car. The car veers a bit to the right. No sight of the rainbow. Let’s try again. Here it is, that
    turn. Maybe a bit to the right, to the left. Perhaps that moment of rainbow happiness is unrepeatable. The village
    is called Sheldyakovo.</p>
<p class="indented-text">First childhood memories? I think I was crying, my mother is wrapping me in the blanket and
    putting me in front of a warm furnace. I even remember when the war started. Dad’s brother Panka is visiting. He’s
    on vacation after finishing military school. Doing cartwheels, walking on his hands, getting rowdy. And suddenly,
    the word WAR. Panka puts on his flares and his cap and hurries back to Orekhovo-Zuevo. No man has returned from the
    war to that Sheldyakovo village.</p>
<p class="indented-text">I also remember a church from which the cross couldn’t be thrown off, so it was just left
    half-hanging. I’m reading memories from my friends - Yuri Grishko, Petr Dik, Boris Frantsuzov - and see that all of
    my generation has come from under that half-hanging cross.</p>
<p class="indented-text">You’re asking me how to become an artist? I think choosing a job as an artist and becoming one
    are two different things. “A chance awaits for everyone” - the words of Alexander Blok, one of my idols. But you
    need to be ready for such a chance. Not everyone who gets an apple to fall on their heads is Newton. Boris
    Frantsuzov was my co-student in Mstyora, we both enrolled inexperienced, just 14-15 years old. But by the end of the
    first year everyone, including him, knew that he was an Artist. I felt confidence just after my personal exhibition
    at the Moscow House of Nations, when I saw the reactions of unbiased guests and critics. In our artistic circle
    everyone belongs to a bias. I don’t think that proving something to someone, getting to that bias is in my life
    goals. It’s much simpler when your profession is earning your bread (preferably with butter).</p>
<p class="indented-text">Teachers? Mstyora is the capital of iconography. Ivan Alexandrovich Fomichev was still alive,
    and the influence of iconographic traditions was strong. Maybe that’s where my love for conventionality comes from.
    Vladimir Yakovlevich Yukin, still quite young, was teaching drawing and painting. We’ve been friends our whole
    lives. There was a very short communication with May Miturich at the polygraphic institute, but the impression was
    immense. Andrey Goncharov was assembling all students in the lecture hall. Those discussions were very emotional.
    The Chelyuskinskaya House of Arts, where artists from all over Russia used to meet, gave us a lot.</p>
<p class="indented-text">There was this anecdote from Chelyuskinskaya. Illarion Golitsyn and someone else were meeting
    artists. They’re walking and looking around, saying nice things, like, “Just a little bit more and you’ll get this!”
    They’re coming to Verkholantsev. He’s a great master of woodcut works, but what’s in the picture? A string woman.
    Everyone’s waiting for Illarion to say something. “It’s not my thing”. Everyone starts barking around. Illarion
    says, frightened: “But I’m not saying it shouldn’t be here!” Silence, everyone goes to other artists. That day I
    learned that if it’s not my thing, it doesn’t mean it shouldn’t exist.</p>
<p class="indented-text">But my age long fascination with printed graphics was a big mistake. With it you have to see
    several steps ahead, but I need everything here and now.</p>
<p class="indented-text">I also consider Henri Matisse, Viktor Sorokin and Vasiliy Shevchenko as my mentors. I try
    everything, examine by feel. At every exhibition, at every studio (doesn’t matter if you like the artist or not) you
    find something new for yourself. Lessons are everywhere.</p>
<p class="indented-text">I’m not afraid of any accusations of eclecticism. Any style emerges from eclecticism and it’s
    foolish to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p class="indented-text">Why flowers? It can seem banal just at first. Painting is self-worth so much that it doesn’t
    matter what you’re portraying, but how. Just wrote this and understood that I was wrong. If one portrays something
    which generates negative emotions, and it is made with power and talent, it will inevitably fire off, like a charged
    gun. An artist should be responsible for their words.</p>
<p class="indented-text">A few years ago one famous person after visiting Paris, the capital of painting, said that
    painting is no more, it is dead. It’s just photographs and installations nowadays. So what? It doesn’t matter which
    tools an artist uses, it matters which charge they bring. There’s an installation at the Moscow Central House of
    Artists: three guys dressed in nice suits are taking a leak on the fourth one, who’s lying down. Nonsense, but some
    people can’t get enough of this kind of spectacle. Freedom is inside a person. A journalist from the Peace Corps
    once asked me, how had I been living under the totalitarian regime? Maybe I was living parallel to both regimes. I
    think that an artist is always cosmopolitan, and art doesn’t need to be translated.</p>
<p class="indented-text">What about elitism? Yes, art is always for the chosen ones. Understanding of art isn’t given to
    a person like a noble title or a rank. But unlike other selectnesses, one just needs to want to understand, to work
    their brain and emotions.</p>
<p class="indented-text">How much nature is in my work? I always have nature in mind, even in some of my most abstract
    works. And then - whenever the path leads me, until “the sound” appears. Fakeness isn’t my thing. Madame Tussauds’
    wax figures are close to the truth, but I don’t consider them art.</p>
<p class="indented-text">Light, color and sound - this is the theme of my work. The sound of contrasts - this is what I
    paint for.</p>
<p class="indented-text">All of this belongs in floral paintings. Flowers not for flowers and not about flowers. Flowers
    in nature are one thing. That is given from above. Flowers on a canvas is a painting.</p>
<p class="indented-text">Light and shadow, the sound of contrasts - that is the reason to paint. The fight of opposites.
    I try for light and good to win. That is an end to itself. Good and love. There’s so much evil in the world, and for
    me to add more of my own negative emotions… I don’t want that!</p>
<p class="indented-text">Why the computer? I’ve been fascinated by new technology for all of my life, and that tool has
    great potential. One time the goose quill was replaced by the steel pen, after that the ball pen appeared. It’s a
    tool, which of course needs to be learnt. There aren’t more or less genius artists because of it. It depends on
    who’s moving the mouse.</p>
<p class="indented-text">As time goes by, I get more attracted to abstract compositions. Any lie would be clear here.
    Can’t hide behind an object, theme or motive. Only composition, spiritual openness, color, rhythm, truth of
    feelings.</p>
<p class="indented-text">Any art is a play, a spectacle. And is this art of play art itself?</p>

<p class="align-right">Lidia Skargina</p>

<h2 id="chapter2">The constant of changeability</h2>

<p class="indented-text">Lidia Vasilievna Skargina (Yurova) leaves an impression of a conflicting person. She is in
    fact changeable in her artistic interests and obsessions. Dissatisfaction or doubts, inquisitiveness or aspiration
    for anything new often make her make a U-turn, come to dead ends and make impressive discoveries. The artist is in a
    permanent state of moving, growing, renewal. She is constant and always interesting in that sense.</p>
<p class="indented-text">Lidia Yurova’s introduction to arts and forming of primary artistic inclinations were
    taking place in the land of the town of Vladimir: under the impact of the traditions of the Mstyora iconographic
    school, where she was learning her first profession of a miniaturist; under the charm of the personality and art of
    a remarkable artist, V.Y. Yukin. She absorbed the spirit of Vladimir landscape painting, but remained free of
    stereotypes. Susceptibility and resistance to influences are one of the character traits of this person. The most
    important thing she had learned from that period is confidence in conventionality of the language of art and the
    importance of formal expression.</p>
<p class="indented-text">Essentially, Lidia Yurova’s professional beginnings were connected with graphics, with
    studying in the Moscow polygraphic institute under major artists and tutors during the “thaw” in Soviet arts. She
    had tried every available technique of printed engraving and drawing, working with watercolor and ink, making
    monotypes. Working in the Houses of Art among remarkable artists had facilitated that as well. In the same diverse
    way she was trying out various styles, feeling out anything suitable for herself. It became clear that working with
    thin hatchings and small details were alien to her. Broad generalizations, clear contours, contrasts between lights
    and shadows, weight of an image - all of that was matching her artistic temperament much more. Already in her early
    graphic sheets her craving for color is apparent: she was highlighting the sheets with two or three colors,
    expressive in their harmony. The energy and pressure were tangible, and they would become distinctive properties of
    her paintings.</p>
<p class="indented-text">Lidia moved to Lipetsk as a mature person. She had begun everything from a blank slate with
    a new last name - Skargina. She was looking for her own niche, proving her right to take her own spot in the
    collective of brilliant artists, in the space of other traditions. And she did so.</p>
<p class="indented-text">Painting was irresistibly attractive, she was being influenced by the art of V.S. Sorokin,
    E.P. Salnikov, distinctive V.E. Shevchenko. She just needed to believe in herself. And make a living as well. The
    artist was exploring the technique of batik, enthusiastically painting on curtains, veils, scarfs, coming up with
    original motifs and compositions, but most importantly, working with color and studying its potential. She is
    weaving tapestries - from small to monumental ones. Making collages. Bravely plunging into the unknown, solving new
    problems. Later she would lunge just as passionately into computer graphics. And each time it is experience learned
    the hard way, leading to liberation. Gradually painting comes to the forefront of Lidia Skargina’s art.</p>
<p class="indented-text">Her repertoire contains almost every genre: landscapes and figure compositions, interiors,
    portraits, still life. But you wouldn’t call them coming from nature. They are about nature. The artist keenly feels
    reality - neutrality of relations is excluded. Signals of reality, perceived passionately, are transformed into art
    by her. Discoveries of anything new and beautiful happen all around her. They appear like enlightenment. The
    irresistible urge to convey an experienced surprise is the power source of Lidia Skargina’s art. She has huge
    creative potential which keeps her on her feet and turns her life into an unending artistic process.</p>
<p class="indented-text">An impulse could appear from a beam of light, a strip of shadow, a crack in the ground, a
    blend of color, a state of weather, an uniqueness of a person, whatever the soul responds to. That echo of the soul
    becomes the content of a work. It’s not a display of something visible which appears on a canvas, but another,
    unreal artistic space, even though there can be some recognizable objects, characters, landscape elements. They are
    involved in a play of fantasy, imagination. The attractive and mysterious world created by the artist intrigues, it
    doesn’t yield to a one-sided interpretation, it plays with the viewer.</p>
<p class="indented-text">The play for Lidia Skargina is a necessary part of her art. And she is a real player,
    giving herself whole to chance, yet asserting her point, trusting her intuition. During the work, one time the
    painter shows her will, another time the painting leads her. This interaction between the creator and the creation
    turns into a dialogue. And if the canvases would never leave the workshop, they would never be considered finished:
    the author can’t resist the temptation to edit or add something. Or just remake the whole thing from scratch because
    of new ideas or doubts. The thing she is afraid of the most in art is boredom, and so she evades any strict rules
    and laws. Rational formulation of an idea is not for her. Improv and experimentation - this is what interests
    her.</p>
<p class="indented-text">Despite all this, a viewer couldn’t see the excruciating struggle of the artists with the
    canvas. They see works, which always impress with the diversity of the vision and feeling, fresh harmony of colors,
    surprise and freedom of formal execution. And the author is recognizable in any of those. Whichever genre a painter
    uses, they unwittingly make an autoportrait. Skargina’s personality, with her intense energy, her romanticism and
    sober look on life, her seeming and present contradictions - all of that is embedded in the canvases, the thick
    paintings, the many layers of colors, the bright flashes of light and color. The works are decorative, dynamic even
    in static form. They’re just beautiful. Her world, her life, her preferences and tastes, her philosophy, her doubts
    and categorical conviction.</p>
<p class="indented-text">When she is asked about the task of her art, Lidia Vasilievna answers evasively. “Painting
    for the sake of painting” is the favourite answer. It’s got its truth: after all, art is the reason for her
    existence. But when you take a glance at everything created by this tireless person, you come to a conclusion that
    Skargina hasn’t made a single work that doesn’t celebrate life. Her art is a generous gift of happiness. The artist
    loves life as it is, not looking for perfection, admiring the beauty of the usual and random. And this is her
    immutability, loyalty to her nature.</p>
